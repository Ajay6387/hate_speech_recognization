# Hate Speech Detection in Tweets

This project aims to detect hate speech in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The dataset used consists of tweets labeled as hate speech or not.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ajay6387/hate_speech_recognization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hate-speech-detection
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `hateDetection_train.csv`. It contains tweets along with their corresponding labels (0 for non-hate speech, 1 for hate speech).

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/hate_speech_detection.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing of tweets.
2. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing the distribution of tweets and generating word clouds.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
4. **Model Training:** Training a Logistic Regression model.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to improve the model.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **XX.XX%** on the test set. The confusion matrix and classification report are provided to understand the performance in detail.

### Notes:
1. Replace `yourusername` in the `git clone` command with your actual GitHub username.
2. Adjust the `accuracy` in the `Results` section to reflect the actual accuracy achieved by your model.
3. Ensure the paths and filenames in the `Project Structure` and `Results` sections match your actual directory and file names.
4. Add a `LICENSE` file if you haven't already, specifying the license under which your project is released.
